    "\n",
    "The cart-pole problem can be considered as the \"Hello World\" problem of Reinforcement Learning (RL). It was described by [Barto (1983)](http://www.derongliu.org/adp/adp-cdrom/Barto1983.pdf). The physics of the system is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* All motion happens in a vertical plane\n",
    "* A hinged pole is attached to a cart\n",
    "* The cart slides horizontally on a track in an effort to balance the pole vertically\n",
    "* The system has four state variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "$x$: displacement of the cart\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\theta$: vertical angle on the pole\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\dot{x}$: velocity of the cart\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\dot{\\theta}$: angular velocity of the pole\n"

    "The purpose of our activity in this blog post is to construct and train an entity, let's call it a *controller*, that can manage the horizontal motions of the cart so that the pole remains as close to vertical as possible. The controlled entity is, of course, the *cart and pole* system."
