# The Use of Social Media Marketing in the Aerospace Industry

## Abstract
This report considers the role of social media marketing in the aerospace industry. What is not always obvious from casual readings on this subject is the highly technical underpinnings of the effective use of this marketing approach. Aerospace marketers often outsource the detailed technical analysis to social media marketers which tend to use deep learning to perform this. These service providers seem to operate as custodians of black boxes.

## Social Media Marketing
The nature of social media conversations span a wide range. At the one extreme, there is gossip around celebrity activities, comments about the breakfast someone just finished, or maybe that her cat had a litter of 5 kittens at midnight. These types of exchanges could be classified as shallow and broad. Some refer to these connection patterns as social networks. The objective of participants is simply to link and have conversations. There are relatively few of these networks but they are large. At the other extreme we find exchanges that can be very focused and deep. These exchanges are made on networks referred to as virtual communities which are smaller in size but much more numerous. The objective of participants is not primarily to communicate, but to accomplish a task or mission. They want guidance from influencers and experts rather than peers on topics they care about. One example is [Engineering 360](https://https://www.globalspec.com/). In a 2014 news report, Wilinsky, describes it as the worldâ€™s largest virtual community for engineers. A few smaller communities are outlined in the article [5 Online Communities About the Aviation Industry You Should Join](https://aviationmaintenance.edu/2014/05/21/5-online-communities-aviation-industry-join/).
