            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) . The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it. . . Interactive Charts With Altair . Charts made with Altair remain interactive.

            "content": "Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | .

            "title": "Weapons Of Math Destruction",
            "content": "Response to Cathy O’Neil’s Weapons of Math Destruction . After reading Cathy O’Neil’s Weapons of Math Destruction, I put down a few comments. Overall, I was impressed by O’Neil’s insight, honesty, sense of responsibility, and ethical focus. Her writing style is to the point, yet wrapped in artistic expression. To get going, she reveals a fundamental principle and problem with model creation: Models are opinions embedded in mathematics. By making choices over the data we collect, the questions we ask, and what data to include or exclude eventually, we impose our ideologies on the models we build. Often we also teach machines how to discriminate, and from then on they perform this disservice extremely efficiently. We allow our machines to capture poisonous prejudices from the past which embed within them the practice of being unfair. . What was also striking to me was the widespread use of proxies instead of using the down-to-earth fundamental data. When proxies are used the data collection effort is usually much cheaper and simpler. However, models created from proxies are much easier to game or to exploit. It is just simpler to manipulate proxies than the complex reality represented by them. For example, auto insurers often use proxies like high school GPA and credit scores as predictors for driving risk, but omits the all-important drunk driving record. O’Neil also reflects on the use of really bad science when correlation is confused with causation, for example in the case of Frederick Hoffman’s 1896 report which basically declares that race is a strong predictor of life expectancy. . O’Neil defines a “Weapon of Math Destruction” as having all three of the elements: Opacity, Scale, and Damage. I think this is an apt definition and these elements collectively shine light on just about every negative thing that could be said about the application of data science in society. Before reading this book, I was mostly unaware of the practices of gross unfairness and exploitation of the value of personal data going on. The uneasy part to me is how we have to make our case to a machine that has been infused with all kinds of prejudices and inaccuracies. We have no insight into the inner workings of this machine, and it does not help to ask either. There does not seem to be a human available to “rescue” us. If we do find a human, the response is usually that it is company policy and “fair” to abide by the machine’s decision. I started experiencing this sense of unease ever since telephone answering machines started making their appearance. There were some workarounds though, I used to just type a bunch of zeros and eventually I got to speak to a human. This book’s content takes the situation much further. . Some of the WMDs O’Neil mentions are recidivism models like the LSI-R, the risk model attached to mortgage-backed securities during the great recession meltdown, the U.S. News &amp; World Report system of rating colleges, personality tests in hiring departments, scheduling software, e-scores (unlike the FICO scores they resemble), and micro-targeting (for example, in the political landscape). I like her suggestion that we should reframe the question of fairness: instead of squabbling over which metric should be used to determine the fairness of an algorithm, we should instead identify all the stakeholders and then consider and weigh the relative harms associated with each of them. The WMDs she mentions certainly do a lot of harm to many stakeholders. I think it makes a lot of sense to try and minimize the harm as much as possible. . It is a good suggestion that we should regulate the mathematical models and algorithms that continue to have an ever-increasing impact on our everyday lives. Not only should the algorithms be held accountable but also the data scientists that construct them. We do need to measure the impact of algorithms and conduct algorithmic audits. Quality assurance practices need to be applied to data science too. As the author puts it, “put the science into data science.” . O’Neil states that the government has a powerful regulatory role to play. The government can begin by enforcing relevant laws that are already in place (FCRA, ECOA, ADA, HIPAA), and also work to make these laws stronger in the area of the application of algorithms. She even suggests that we could follow the European model which demands that all data collected must be approved by the user in the form of an opt-in. In addition, the reuse of data for other purposes is illegal, in other words, user data may not be sold. Another point made by O’Neil is that models that have significant impact on us, for example credit scores and e-scores, should be open and available to the public with the right to request data modification in case of errors. All of these points make a lot of sense to me. The time is ripe for the government to take action. Exploitation of the value of data obtained from the general public, but in particular from less privileged citizens, has gone on far too long. .",
